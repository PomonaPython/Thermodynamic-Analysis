# Thermodynamic-Analysis

Our project will include a coded
Graphical User Interface using python to solve a
basic Rankine Cycle, a fundamental concept in
thermodynamics widely employed in power
generation and other energy conversion systems.
The GUI serves as a user-friendly platform to
visualize and interact with Rankine Cycle
parameters resulting in an easier way to solve such
problems.
